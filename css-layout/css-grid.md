## Guiding questions

### CSS Grid Terminology

#### Grid area

- From what you know so far, how is Flexbox similar to Grid?

  > Both have a "containing" element and individual "items" which can be affected by CSS rules.

### Properties of a Grid Container

#### Justify & Align Items

- "Justify" and "align" are not the most intuitive names for horizontal and vertical alignment. What's a memorization tool or phrase (i.e., "mnemonic device") we can use to help us remember?

  > No right answer. Maybe "uh-lign" is like "up"?

#### Example: Grid Template Areas

- What happens if we reorder the elements within the `.grid-container`?

  > The elements are still placed in their designated spots.
